TFC model
=========

TFC (Trusted Friend Computing) is a POP-Java object sharing model, which can be implemented in any context.

The model allows to share objects and resources of a given program or module between nodes in a network, without having to run any third party code on a given machine (see :num:`tfc-model`).

    Nodes sharing the same program/module

A typical use case of TFC appears e.g. when someone wants to publish an object and someone else to find and use that object (see basic and advanced examples in the next sections).
